    <h1>distro_rating</h1>

    <p>The best GNU/Linux distributions, in my opinion. In order from the best to worst</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Gentoo <br><br>
            + Great package manager<br>
            + Ability to fully configure the system to your likings<br>
            My main distribution for the last 1.5 years
        </li>
        <li>
            Fedora<br><br>
            + Works really great out of the box<br>
            + One of the best supported/maintained distributions
        </li>
        <li>
            Arch<br><br>
            <s>I USE ARCH BTW</s><br>
            + Has similar philosophy to Gentoo - you configure your system from the ground-up<br>
            + AUR
        </li>
        <li>
            Debian testing<br><br>
            + The debian we love and hate, with more up-to-date packages
        </li>
        <li>
            Ubuntu / Kubuntu<br><br>
            + Works out of the box<br>
            + Very popular ( someone has probably already solved the problem you have )<br>
            - Forced adoption of snaps
        </li>
    </ol>
