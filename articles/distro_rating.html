  <p>The best GNU+Linux distributions, in my opinion. In order from the best to worst</p>
  <h5>Last updated - 30th May 2023</h5>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Gentoo <br><br>
      + Great package manager<br>
      + Ability to fully configure the system to your likings<br>
      - Long compile times, especially on older hardware<br>
      <s>My main distribution for the last 1.5 years</s>
      Switched to arch, see <a href="#switched-to-arch">arch</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Fedora<br><br>
      + Works really great out of the box<br>
      + One of the best supported/maintained distributions
    </li>
    <li>
      Arch<br><br>
      <s>I USE ARCH BTW</s><br>
      My main distribution from February 2023<br>
      + Has similar philosophy to Gentoo - you configure your system from the ground-up<br>
      + AUR <br>
      + <abbr title="You use your system the way you like. I'm looking at you, Ubuntu!">Doesn't get in your
        way&#8482;</abbr>
      <p>
        I switched to arch because of it's simplicity relative to Gentoo. I realized that I don't
        really need all the flexibility that Gentoo provides. There was no profit from building all packages for
        myself.
        All I got was a heated laptop and wasted CPU cycles. Arch still has AUR, where you can find <code>-git</code>
        versions of most packages. Writing your own <code>PKGBUILD</code> file is also fairly easy. I haven't found
        myself
        writing <code>PKGBUILD</code> files by hand yet, though.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Debian testing<br><br>
      + The debian we love and hate, but with more up-to-date packages
    </li>
    <li>
      Ubuntu / Kubuntu<br><br>
      + Works out of the box<br>
      + Very popular ( someone has probably already solved the problem you have )<br>
      - Forced adoption of snaps
    </li>
  </ol>
